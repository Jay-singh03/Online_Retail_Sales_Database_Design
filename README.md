# Online_Retail_Sales_Database_Design

üìò Overview

The Online Retail Sales Database Design project is a structured SQL-based database that models a small-scale online retail system.
It includes Products, Customers, Orders, and Payments tables to simulate real-world online sales operations.
This project also demonstrates the use of joins, views, and aggregate functions for generating meaningful sales reports.
